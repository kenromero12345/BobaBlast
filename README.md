# BobaBlast

A bubble tea-themed tower defense game with JavaScript as the game engine.

What I learned:

Incorporated enemy sprite animation and collision detection for better visuals on JavaScript.

Used breadth-first search algorithm for enemy path finding to improve gameplay.

#Our food has come to life and started attacking and we only have boba to stop them!
#Luckly we have been trying a brand new technology to shoot boba
#Click to place shooters and create a maze to stop the evil food before they get us!!
